# Introduction to Functional Architecture @ Software Architecture Gathering 2021

## Following along

If you want to write and play around with the code at the workshop
yourself, we recommend you install a ghc Haskell environment.  You can
do this as follows:

- install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- if applicable (macOS), give the Docker VM ggf. at least 6GB RAM
- install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- install the "Remote - Containers" extension:
  (Click on the  extensions icon on the left, search for "Containers",
  select "Remote - Containers",  click "Install")
- click on the File icon in the upper-left corner
- select "View" -> "Command Palette", and type
  "containers", select "Remote - Containers: Open Folder in Container"
- select `haskell-code` folder
- open file `Intro.hs` and make a small change


A message should appear that it's building a Docker image.  This might
take a while, but should happen without an error message.

In case of problems, contact Mike Sperber.
